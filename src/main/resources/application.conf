  # use the PinnedDispatcher

  # i.e. each actor will have its own thread pool with only one thread in the pool.
  # We need this because will need to make the Worker thread to sleep for X time
  # Anything that blocks a thread is not advised within Akka. 
  # If the Actor is configured with a a shared thread pool (default behavior) then using 
  # Thread.sleep will withhold a thread from that pool that could be doing work for other Actors
